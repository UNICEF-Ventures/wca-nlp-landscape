# UNICEF relevance
unicef_relevance: >
  Relevant for UNICEF Ghana's language tech needs through their African language AI services
  covering major Ghanaian languages (Akan, Ewe, Ga, Dagbani). Their native-speaker dataset
  creation and model evaluation capabilities could support quality assurance of NLP tools.
  However, their primarily commercial and closed approach limits direct integration — they
  are a data services company rather than an open-source contributor.

maturity: emerging
engagement_status: none
openness: closed  # No public models, only 2 datasets on HuggingFace, commercial services
last_updated: 2026-02-06

notes: >
  Primarily an AI training data company serving enterprise clients rather than an NLP
  research or product org. Their African language work focuses on dataset creation and
  model evaluation services rather than building open models. Only two datasets published
  on HuggingFace (both MIT-licensed speech datasets), no public models. Deepfake detection
  (Nokore AI) is a separate product line not directly relevant to NLP/language tech.
  Website claims 50+ African languages but only 6 are explicitly named.
