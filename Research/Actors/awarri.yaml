# UNICEF relevance
unicef_relevance: >
  Building open-source Nigerian language models (LLM + ASR) with government backing.
  N-ATLAS is the most significant government-private partnership for African language AI.
  Voice-first approach aligns with low-literacy use cases. LangEasy's crowdsourced data
  collection model could be leveraged for UNICEF's community engagement. Already
  partnered with NCAIR (existing actor).

maturity: emerging  # Models released Sept 2025, still iterating
engagement_status: none
openness: partial  # Open for research; commercial license required above 1,000 users
last_updated: 2026-01-26

notes: >
  N-ATLAS models are published under the NCAIR1 HuggingFace org (government partnership),
  not under AWARRITech. Human evaluation shows English (4.21/5) and Hausa (3.98/5) perform
  well, Igbo (3.87/5) is decent, but Yoruba (2.69/5) still needs work. Developer challenge
  with NGN 1M prizes to encourage ecosystem building around N-ATLAS.
