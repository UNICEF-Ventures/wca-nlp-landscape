  CLEAR Global's mission is to help people get information and be heard, whatever
  language they speak. Evolved from Translators without Borders (TWB), which continues
  to exist as a community of over 100,000 volunteer linguists worldwide. CLEAR Global
  taps into this vast community for its language technology projects, combining
  human linguistic expertise with AI to build speech and translation tools for
  underserved languages.

  Develops open-source ASR, TTS, and MT models for crisis-affected and low-resource
  languages. Flagship initiative TWB Voice is a voice data collection platform
  integrated with the TWB linguist community, enabling scalable speech data collection.
  Pilot phase collected 125+ hours of speech in Hausa, Kanuri, and Shuwa Arabic --
  producing the first openly available voice datasets for Kanuri and Shuwa Arabic,
  and the first humanitarian-domain speech data for all three. Also works on Lingala
  and Congolese Swahili through the LT4CR and SynVoices projects.

    description: >
      Voice data collection platform integrated with the Translators without Borders
      community of 100,000+ linguists. Supports ASR and TTS data workflows. Pilot
      phase (2024-2025) collected speech in three northeast Nigerian languages:
      Hausa (~58hrs ASR, ~10hrs TTS, 144 contributors), Kanuri (~52hrs ASR, ~10hrs TTS,
      52 contributors), Shuwa Arabic (~15hrs ASR, 22 contributors). Fine-tuned
      Whisper and Wav2Vec 2.0 models achieving 2.23% WER for Hausa and 10.16% WER
      for Kanuri. First openly available voice datasets for Kanuri and Shuwa Arabic.
      All data and models published under open licenses on HuggingFace.

# UNICEF relevance
unicef_relevance: >
  CLEAR Global is conducting this UNICEF WCARO NLP landscape mapping consultancy.
  TWB Voice directly addresses WCA language gaps -- producing the first open speech
  datasets for Kanuri and Shuwa Arabic, both WCA crisis languages. LT4CR covers
  Lingala and Congolese Swahili (DRC priority). The TWB community of 100,000+
  linguists is an unmatched resource for language data collection. TWB Voice Playbook
  provides a replicable methodology for UNICEF country offices. Already a UNICEF
  partner.
