# UNICEF relevance
unicef_relevance: >
  Senegalese company with established institutional partnerships (USAID, UNIDO, ITC).
  Adia_TTS is one of very few open Wolof TTS models (Apache 2.0). Their
  entrepreneurship platform and Tambali AI co-pilot demonstrate practical deployment
  of Wolof language technology. Adds to Senegal actor coverage alongside GalsenAI
  and Baamtu. Relevant for March 2026 Senegal summit.

maturity: emerging  # Established as company (2020), but NLP work is recent
engagement_status: none
openness: partial  # Adia_TTS is Apache 2.0; platform is commercial
last_updated: 2026-01-26

notes: >
  Primary business is entrepreneurship support, not NLP. AI work is a recent
  expansion. Many HuggingFace Spaces are currently in error state, suggesting
  active development. Moustapha Sarr and Hawoly Deme are also affiliated with
  "Startup SamaIA" -- possibly a sister initiative. "Sama" means "my" in Wolof.
