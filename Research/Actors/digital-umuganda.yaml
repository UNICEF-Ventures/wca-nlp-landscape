# UNICEF relevance
unicef_relevance: >
  Past contact of CLEAR Global (MT Rwanda collaboration). AfriVoice dataset directly
  covers WCA languages: Lingala (517hrs), Fulani/Fulfulde (527hrs), and Wolof (531hrs) --
  all priority languages for UNICEF WCA. Their community-driven "digital umuganda" data
  collection methodology is replicable for other WCA languages that lack speech data.
  OD4A initiative spans 14 countries and 17 languages. ANV project partners include
  WCA actors RobotsMali and Data Science Nigeria.

maturity: established
engagement_status: none
openness: open  # CC-BY-4.0 datasets, Common Voice contributions
last_updated: 2026-01-26

notes: >
  Rwanda-based (not WCA), but directly relevant due to: (1) AfriVoice dataset covering
  Lingala, Fulfulde, and Wolof, (2) CLEAR Global collaboration on MT Rwanda, (3) ANV
  project partnerships with WCA actors (RobotsMali, DSN), (4) replicable community
  data collection model. Their 2,200hrs Kinyarwanda Common Voice contribution
  demonstrates what's achievable with community mobilization. OD4A's scale (4,500hrs
  across 17 languages, 14 countries) makes them one of the larger open data producers
  for African languages.
