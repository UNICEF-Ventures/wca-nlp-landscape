  Didactic Paper award at ICLR Singapore.

  Key programs include the annual AI Bootcamp (physical training for 500 candidates
  after free AI classes in multiple cities) and sector-specific AI solution development.

# UNICEF relevance
unicef_relevance: >
  Highly relevant for UNICEF's Nigeria operations. DSN has the largest AI talent
  community in Africa, making them a key partner for building local capacity for
  NLP/AI projects. Their voice dataset work (african_voice_ng) directly supports
  Nigerian language technology development. Their reach into both Anglophone and
  Francophone communities in Nigeria makes them valuable for cross-linguistic
  initiatives. Could serve as implementation partner or talent pipeline for
  UNICEF AI projects in Nigeria.

notes: >
  Primarily a talent development and community organization rather than a research
  lab. Strong convening power with 14,000+ members. UNESCO IRCAI recognition
  (5 products in Global Top 100) demonstrates quality of their AI solutions.
  The african_voice_ng dataset on HuggingFace (updated Nov 2025) shows active
  contribution to language data resources. Good entry point for engaging Nigeria's
  AI ecosystem.
