# UNICEF relevance
unicef_relevance: >
  Highly relevant for UNICEF's agricultural and nutrition programs. Darli AI's voice-first
  approach (27+ languages) addresses low-literacy populations - directly applicable to
  UNICEF's communication challenges. Their extensive open ASR/TTS models could be
  repurposed for health messaging, education, and community engagement. Already proven
  at scale: 1M+ users, 2.3M farmers reached, 60+ countries. The Mergdata platform's
  offline capability suits rural deployment. Strong presence in UNICEF priority countries
  (Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Mali, Sierra Leone, Senegal). Collaboration with
  University of Ghana HCI Lab shows academic-industry partnership model.

notes: >
  One of the most prolific producers of open African language speech models. 33+ models
  and 21+ datasets on HuggingFace covering 20+ languages. Unique combination of agtech
  domain expertise with ML research. The FarmerlineML and DarliAI HuggingFace orgs are
  connected - Emmanuel Kissi (misterkissi) is key ML contributor. Collaboration with
  University of Ghana HCI Lab (Farmerline <> DCS HCI org on HuggingFace). Christine
  Lagarde (ECB President) praised them as "an innovative company using technology for good."
