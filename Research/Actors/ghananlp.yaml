description: >
  Ghana NLP is an open-source initiative focused on Natural Language Processing for Ghanaian
  and African languages. They developed Khaya, the first AI-powered translation app for
  Ghanaian languages, which has expanded to cover 17 languages including Kenyan and Nigerian
  languages. Their translation models outperform Google Translate for Ghanaian languages.
  The name "Khaya" comes from the African Mahogany tree and means "home" in several
  Southern African languages. The team now also operates Khaya AI (khaya.ai) as a commercial
  startup offering enterprise API access for African language translation, ASR, and TTS.

# UNICEF relevance
unicef_relevance: >
  (Auto generated) Directly relevant for UNICEF Ghana's AGOO platform and Asempa AI companion, which users
  are requesting in local languages. Khaya already supports all major Ghanaian languages
  (Twi, Dagbani, Ewe, Ga) that AGOO uses. Their API could be integrated into existing
  UNICEF platforms. Translation + ASR + TTS stack enables voice-first interfaces for
  low-literacy users. Volunteer-driven model means potential for co-development partnerships.
  Also covers Yoruba (Nigeria) which could support other country offices.

maturity: established
engagement_status: none
last_updated: 2026-01-19

notes: >
  (Auto generated) Strong technical team led by MIT PhD. Production-ready apps on App Store and Play Store.
  API available for integration. Outperforms Google Translate for covered languages.
  105 contributors shows strong community. Expanding beyond Ghana to Kenya and Nigeria
  demonstrates scalability. Could be key partner for UNICEF Ghana's language tech needs.
