  GO AI Corp is a Burkinabè technology startup providing AI solutions, web/mobile
  development, cybersecurity, and cloud services. They co-developed NLP models for
  the Moore language in partnership with UNICEF Burkina Faso, building speech-to-text,
  text-to-speech, and French-Moore translation tools integrated into UNICEF's UYouth
  and U-Report platforms.

  They offer an API for Moore language AI and several commercial SaaS products.
  Have released 8 Mooré datasets on HuggingFace (gated, non-commercial license),
  but keep trained model weights private.

notes: >
  Partial openness - datasets available (with restrictions) but models
  closed. Website marketing claims lack technical documentation. For social impact
  projects, fully open models are preferable for independent evaluation, community
  improvements, and sustainability. However, they have demonstrated real deployment
  with UNICEF and have invested in creating Mooré datasets.
