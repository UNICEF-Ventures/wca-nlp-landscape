  Research lab within the Department of Computer Science at University of Ghana, led by
  Prof. Isaac Wiafe. Focused on Human-Computer Interaction, persuasive technology, and
  AI/ML for African languages. The lab has produced the largest open speech corpus for
  Ghanaian languages: UGSpeechData with 5,000 hours across 5 languages (Akan, Ewe,
  Dagbani, Dagaare, Ikposo - 1,000 hours each, 100 hours transcribed per language).
  Current flagship project Tɛkyerɛma Pa ("Good Tongue") develops ASR for people with
  speech impairments in collaboration with Google Research Africa and UCL GDI Hub.
  Additional work includes maternal health translation systems and TTS development.

# UNICEF relevance
unicef_relevance: >
  Extremely relevant for UNICEF Ghana and regional language technology needs. The 5,000-hour
  UGSpeechData corpus is the largest open speech dataset for Ghanaian languages - a foundational
  resource for any voice-based application. The Tɛkyerɛma Pa project directly serves people
  with disabilities, aligning with UNICEF's inclusive technology mandate. Maternal health
  translation work supports health communication programs. The lab has proven ability to
  collaborate with major tech companies (Google) and international organizations (UCL).
  Could support AGOO platform, Asempa AI companion, and health messaging in Akan, Ewe,
  Dagbani, Dagaare. Academic setting enables research partnerships and student involvement.

notes: >
  Major resource hub for Ghanaian language technology. The 5,000-hour UGSpeechData corpus
  is a game-changer for the region. Strong leadership with Prof. Isaac Wiafe (947 citations)
  and Prof. Jamal-Deen Abdulai (1,696 citations, current HOD). Google Research collaboration
  through Katrin Tomanek brings world-class expertise. The Tɛkyerɛma Pa hackathon engaged
  students across Ghana (winner: Kasa Noma team from UESD, $2,500 prize). Lab members also
  collaborate with Farmerline on agricultural speech tech. Individual researchers contribute
  via personal HuggingFace accounts (fiifinketia, GiftMark, Paywinful, IsaacWiafe).
