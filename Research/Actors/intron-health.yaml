description: >
  Africa-focused voice AI startup (formerly Intron Health, rebranded mid-2025 as they
  expanded beyond healthcare). Builds the "infrastructure layer for voice interactions
  across Africa." Develops the Sahara model family: Sahara-Optimus (ASR for 300+ African
  accents, 92%+ accuracy), Sahara-Nova (real-time streaming), Sahara-TTS (80+ voices,
  40+ accents, 13 countries), Sahara-Voice-Lock (biometric voice auth), and upcoming
  Sahara-Titan (multilingual ASR for 20 African languages) and Sahara-Primus
  (multilingual TTS).

  Proprietary AccentMix algorithm trained on 3.5M+ audio clips from 18,000+ speakers
  across 30+ countries. Deployed in 30+ hospitals across 5 markets (Nigeria, Kenya,
  Rwanda, South Africa, Uganda). Also deployed for court transcription (Ogun State
  Judiciary) and fintech call centers (Branch International). Created major open
  datasets including AfriSpeech-200 (200hrs, 120 accents) and AfriMed-QA (15,275
  medical questions, 32 specialties, 16 countries).

# UNICEF relevance
unicef_relevance: >
  Directly relevant to UNICEF's healthcare AI goals. Sahara-Titan will cover 20
  African languages including Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo. AfriSpeech-200 and AfriMed-QA
  provide critical benchmarks for evaluating AI tools in African healthcare settings.
  Already deployed in Rwanda (Ministry of Health nationwide), Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda.
  Gates Foundation/Google/PATH partnership for LLM evaluation aligns with UNICEF's
  need to assess AI tool readiness.

notes: >
  Formerly "Intron Health", rebranded mid-2025 as they expanded beyond healthcare into
  legal, fintech, and other sectors. Currently focused on accented English -- Sahara-Titan
  (local African languages) is still in development. NaijaVoices lists Intron as a partner.
  Chris Emezue (NaijaVoices) co-authored AfriSpeech-200 and AfriNames papers. Real-world
  impact: reduced radiology result wait times from 48 hours to 20 minutes; court
  transcription times nearly halved.
