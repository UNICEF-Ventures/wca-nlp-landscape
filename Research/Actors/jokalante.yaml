# UNICEF relevance
unicef_relevance: >
  Directly relevant as a Senegal-based organization building speech technology and
  AI chatbots for local languages with agricultural and climate focus. KALLAAMA
  dataset covers Wolof, Pulaar, and Sereer -- languages that currently lack dedicated
  actors. The NAFOORE platform and IVR/SMS infrastructure reaching 1M+ rural users
  is exactly the kind of community engagement infrastructure UNICEF programs use.
  Relevant for the March 2026 Senegal summit.

maturity: established  # Operating since 2016, but AI/NLP work is recent
engagement_status: none
openness: open  # KALLAAMA dataset is CC-BY 4.0
last_updated: 2026-01-26

notes: >
  Primary expertise is rural digital services, not AI research. Their entry into NLP
  is driven by practical need (reaching farmers who speak local languages). The KALLAAMA
  dataset is one of very few open speech resources for Pulaar and Sereer. HuggingFace
  profile has no public models or datasets yet (data hosted on GitHub/OpenSLR instead).
  70% of surveyed users reported reduced material losses from timely weather alerts.
