# Organization details
founded: 2020
organization_size: small
funding: >
  Mila Quebec AI Institute Entrepreneurship Lab partnership. UNESCO/ViVaTech prize.
  Shuttleworth Flash Grant (Bonaventure Dossou).
description: >
  Non-profit platform that catalogs, archives, and connects African language technology
  resources (datasets, papers, models, tools). Addresses the discoverability problem --
  African language resources are fragmented across many platforms and hard to find.
  Covers 2,199 African languages with 1,000+ AI resources catalogued. Uses custom
  algorithms to detect which African language(s) a resource involves, even when not
  explicitly stated. Participatory approach allows community contributions. Goal:
  200,000 linked records by 2026.

  Founded by Chris Emezue (Nigeria) and Bonaventure Dossou (Benin), both core
  Masakhane researchers. Advised by Turing Award winner Yoshua Bengio. Won first
  place at UNESCO/ViVaTech 2021 challenge for "Overcoming Language Barriers through
  Data and AI."

      Centralized catalog of African language resources. Aggregates datasets, papers,
      and models from arXiv, AfricArXiv, Zenodo, and other sources. Custom NLP
      algorithms identify African languages in resources. 2,199 languages indexed,
      1,000+ AI resources.

# UNICEF relevance
unicef_relevance: >
  Essential discovery platform for African language technology resources. Any UNICEF
  programme seeking to identify available NLP tools, datasets, and models for WCA
  languages should use Lanfrica as a starting point. The founders are deeply embedded
  in the Masakhane and broader AfricaNLP community. Could serve as a resource mapping
  tool for UNICEF's technology selection process. Won UNESCO/ViVaTech challenge.

maturity: established
engagement_status: none
openness: open  # Platform freely accessible, founders publish openly
last_updated: 2026-01-26

notes: >
  Lanfrica is a meta-resource (catalog) rather than a technology builder. The founders
  also run NaijaVoices (Chris Emezue) and contributed to Masakhane/FFR (Bonaventure
  Dossou). Yoshua Bengio's advisory role adds credibility. Platform code is not
  open source but the catalog itself is freely accessible.
