# Organization details
founded: 2021
organization_size: small
funding: >
  Lacuna Fund grant (Rockefeller Foundation, Google.org). Revenue from commercial
  licensing of the dataset reinvested into Language Heritage Micro-Grants.
description: >
  Community-driven initiative building Africa's largest speech datasets for Nigerian
  languages. The NaijaVoices dataset contains 1,800+ hours of speech from 5,000+
  speakers across Igbo, Hausa, and Yoruba -- making it the largest multi-speaker
  African speech dataset to date. Uses a "data farming" methodology where communities
  cultivate, own, and benefit from their language data (as opposed to extractive
  "data mining"). Fine-tuning ASR models on the dataset showed dramatic improvements:
  75.86% WER reduction (Whisper), 52.06% (MMS), 42.33% (XLSR).

  Runs the Language Heritage Micro-Grants program, reinvesting dataset revenue into
  community-driven documentation of endangered Nigerian languages (2025 cohort covers
  Ehugbo, Nupe, Tyap, Gbagyi, Ekpeye, Ibono, Obolo).

# UNICEF relevance
unicef_relevance: >
  Large open speech dataset for Nigeria's three major languages (Igbo, Hausa, Yoruba)
  directly relevant to UNICEF Nigeria -- a priority country. Community-driven "data
  farming" methodology aligns with UNICEF values around participation and ownership.
  Fine-tuned ASR models show dramatic WER improvements. Micro-grants program expands
  coverage to endangered Nigerian languages. Chris Emezue is a central node connecting
  NaijaVoices, Lanfrica, and Masakhane.
