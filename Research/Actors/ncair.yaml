# UNICEF relevance
unicef_relevance: >
  Critical government partner for NLP work in Nigeria. NCAIR has developed production-ready
  ASR models for Nigeria's three major languages (Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo) plus Nigerian English.
  N-ATLAS LLM could power chatbots and information services in local languages. As a government
  entity, they have mandate and resources for scaling. Direct alignment with UNICEF Nigeria's
  digital programmes.

maturity: established
engagement_status: none
openness: partial  # Models on HuggingFace but no GitHub, limited documentation
last_updated: 2026-01-19

notes: >
  Government-backed with significant resources (134 staff). N-ATLAS launched at UN General Assembly
  2024 signals political commitment. Models on HuggingFace are open-source. Focus on practical
  applications in agriculture, health, education. Could be strategic partner for scaling
  UNICEF language tech across Nigeria.
