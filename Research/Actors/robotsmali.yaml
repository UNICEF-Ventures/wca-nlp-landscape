# Organization details
founded: 2017
organization_size: medium
funding: >
  Grant-funded. Supported by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Google, UNESCO, World Bank,
  Mali's Ministry of Education, and AI4D Africa (IDRC).
description: >
  RobotsMali is a centre dedicated to training and innovation in robotics and artificial
  intelligence, working to democratize access to emerging technologies in Mali and West Africa.
  Their AI4D Lab focuses on NLP for Bambara and other Malian national languages to support
  education, health care and entrepreneurship. They have trained 9,000+ students in STEM,
  robotics, and AI. Following Mali's 2023 decision to replace French with 13 local languages
  as official languages, RobotsMali is creating AI-powered educational materials in local languages.

# UNICEF relevance
unicef_relevance: >
  (Auto generated) Highly relevant for UNICEF Mali and education programming across WCA. RobotsMali has
  demonstrated impact: 9,000+ students trained, 180 AI-generated books in local languages,
  and proven literacy outcomes (67-90% reading improvement). Their Bambara ASR and MT models
  directly support low-literacy content delivery. Strong government relationship following
  Mali's language policy shift. Model for AI-enabled education in local languages that could
  be replicated across the region.
