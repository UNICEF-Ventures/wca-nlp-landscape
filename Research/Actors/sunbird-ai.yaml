description: >
  Sunbird AI is a non-profit research organization based in Kampala, Uganda that builds
  and deploys practical AI systems for African contexts. Their focus areas include:
  speech/language processing, geospatial and environmental sensing, and public-sector
  decision support.

  Key technical work: ASR, TTS, translation, and language models for African languages;
  remote sensing and urban growth mapping; biodiversity acoustics; and tools for
  evidence-informed decision-making in public institutions. They maintain curated
  corpora, annotation guidelines, and evaluation sets as data infrastructure.

  Their flagship product is Sunflower, a multilingual LLM series (14B and 32B parameters)
  supporting 31+ Ugandan languages for translations, summaries, and explanations.

# UNICEF relevance
unicef_relevance: >
  While Uganda is in East Africa (not WCA), Sunbird AI's approach and technology stack
  is highly relevant as a model for UNICEF's language technology initiatives in WCA.
  Their Sunflower LLM architecture could be adapted for WCA languages. Their experience
  with citizen feedback tools, environmental monitoring, and public-sector AI deployment
  provides valuable lessons. Could be a technical partner or advisor for similar
  initiatives in WCA countries.
